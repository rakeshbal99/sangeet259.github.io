My name is Sangeet Kumar Mishra , I am from Jajpur , Odisha. I am pursuing my undergaduate studies in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in the Dept. of Civil Engineering. <br>
Interested in the field of Data Science , I love learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts , as it's everywhere and as **Andrew Ng** says it's the new electricty !<br>
Though I am n civil undergrad but I code all the time . And all this is possible because of the great community IIT Kharagpur has !
